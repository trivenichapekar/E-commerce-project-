Problem Statement
A project with an Ecommerce company sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want. The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website. They have asked to help them figure it out. 
# Dataset Details
We worked with the Ecommerce Customers csv file from the company. It has Customer info, such as Email, Address, and their color Avatar. Then it also has numerical value columns:

•	Avg. Session Length: Average session of in-store style advice sessions in minutes.
•	Time on App: Average time spent on App in minutes
•	Time on Website: Average time spent on Website in minutes
•	Length of Membership: How many years the customer has been a member.
•	Yearly Amount Spent: The total amount the customer is spending in dollars.
